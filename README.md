## What is blujam? 

BluJam is a 48 hour game making jam held yearly at Victoria University of Wellington. Participants get given a random theme and 48 hours to develop a game using only Java and its native libraries. Or the ecs100 library, used for teaching first years. 

## Our submission

We went for a top down zombie-esque shooter. Great designs added by our designer George and code written by Andrew and Jonah. (McGoo and Dayyad). The theme was "blue" so we embraced this as much as possible with the level design. 

Here are some screen shots.
